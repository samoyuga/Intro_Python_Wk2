**List Operations in Python**
This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates various list operations. The script performs the following tasks:
Creates an empty list
Appends elements to the list
Inserts an element at a specific position
Extends the list with another list
Removes the last element
Sorts the list
Finds the index of a specific value

**Code Overview**
The script performs these operations in sequence, printing the list state after each operation for clarity.
Operations Performed:
Initialize an empty list my_list
Append elements: 10, 20, 30, 40
Insert value 15 at the second position (index 1)
Extend the list with [50, 60, 70]
Remove the last element
Sort the list in ascending order
Find and print the index of the value 30

**Usage**
Clone the repository or copy the script
Run the Python script:

**The script will print the list after each operation and finally display the index of the value 30:**
text
After appending: [10, 20, 30, 40]
After inserting 15: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40]
After extending: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70]
After removing last element: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
After sorting: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
Index of 30: 3
